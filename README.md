trying to make the most realistic factory game without filling the emergency clinics with brain aneurysms

## lore:
so yea i wanted to do a minecraft mod on 1.7, just to find out that the forge people shto their maven and MDK servers. 
it was supposed to be based off the [Nuclear Tech Mod from HBMinecraft](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
and the owner of that repo/mod is very much against automation which is my life goal i decided to make my own thing out of it
here we are, RIG!


### tl;dr its a physics sim * factory building + Gregtech Complexity - repetitivy and grindy


have fun yall, commits of any kind are always welcome, DM me on discord: CreepTV#9128, invite to the [server](https://discord.gg/NTYMgvZeM7)

okay so; this will also have certain arcane aspects and thaumaturgy... stay tuned
