trying to make the most realistic factory game without filling the emergency clinics with brain aneurysms


so yea i wanted to do a minecraft mod on 1.7, just to find out that the forge people shto their maven and MDK servers. 
it was supposed to be based off the Nuclear Tech Mod from HBMinecraft (https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
and the owner of that repo/mod is very much against automation which is my life goal i decided to make my own thing outta it
here we are, RIG!

tl;dr its a physics sim * factory building + Gregtech Complexity
